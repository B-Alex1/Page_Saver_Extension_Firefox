# Page_Saver_Extension_Firefox
Extension that saves one onr several webpages by simulating pressing a next page button.
 	
This add-on just presses the "next page" button, and the user chooses how many pages they want to save. All the files are saved into the "Downloads" folder. It allows us to store the data of our website into files on our computers. It identifies the "next page" button through the html.
